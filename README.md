Landing page project based on specs from The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page

All HTML and CSS done from scratch.
In this project, I used flexbox to create a modern website layout. I learned how to translate a visual mockup into HTML and CSS.
